              "\"hi so today we are going to talk about AI agentic workflow an AI agentic framework or workflow refers to a structured approach or system design to create manage and deploy these autonomous AI agents these agents are software entities capable of making decisions and Performing task independently the framework provide the necessary tools libraries and protocol for developing these agents enabling them to interact with each other the environment and possibly human users to achieve a specific goal so in this video today we are specifically going to write these AI agents using the python code before we jump into the code let's see what's happening here as you can see there's a mult multiple ways an input can come to an AI agent this can be mail or somebody chatting with a chatbot or there's a voice command and this AI agent opens A Jero ticket and another agent get activated which looks at the ticket and figure it out what need to be done suppose it's supposed to create a VM and it deploys and then tells the next agent go and inform the user the work is done and that agent will interact maybe it will send a mail or go back to chatbot or a voice commands or the voice message is sent that your work is done another agent resolves the ticket so there are multiple agents they are interacting with each other so when I'm looking these agents it's reminding me of our microservice architecture remember we used to have these microservices in the back end and each service used to have a very narrow responsibility of whatever task they need to done so there will be multiple microservices and we know how all the benefits about the microservice architecture right it it makes the system robust it's easier to manage easier to debug they can deploy separately update it separately things like that and very similar those benefits come here also when we have multiple AI agents and they all have a very narrow responsibility so they can fine tune for a specific task now before we write the python code I want to talk about what other Frameworks are available in the market today to write these agents there are multiple framework available today many of them are uh no code low code options so as you can see here crew AI autogen Cassidy n8n a AI relevance AI voice flow mind studio and custom AI studio so as you can see there are multiple options there to build this agents maybe one day I will create a video using each of these different place form but today we are going to use open Ai and building an agent from ground up using open Ai and writing the these agent code in Python itself but before we jump to the code I want to show you this paper it's called mixture of Agents enhances large language model capabilities very interesting paper which shows you how the you can use agents to really improve the output and in this paper they try to answer can we harness the collective expertise of multiple llm to create a more capable and robust model so what they have done here they have built three agents and these agents are built on different llms not necessarily they are GPT 40 or so they are less capable llm models but when you stack them one on top of each other that one agent take the input from the next agent so ultimately the output from these three less capable agents beat the bigger model so as you can see here that single model always get beaten up by this multiple agents so this is a one very nice beautiful example that why you need this agents which can really improve the overall system let's get back to our agents and see another example here you can have another HR agent which is answering different questions of users there are a separate agent about vacations one agent is talking about your 401k One agent may be giving you answers about your immigration St us and these agents can go in the backend talk to the Enterprise database or agents can call an API now let's see what code we are going to write just to make things interesting we are going to write the simple code where we have one agent and we'll have a agent which can tell you about your vacation and one agent which can tell you about weather so these are two very different agents and how they will work together so now let's look at our code so as you can see I'm using open Ai and I have two functions get current weather and get vacation we'll look at the these methods more deeply and then we have a method called agent orchestrator and it's very simple code here we take the user input and the agent orchestrator figure it out which agent should do this task let's run this code first okay now the code is running and waiting for the user input so let's say user comes and they are not very Savvy and they just type word called weather and here as you can see agent is very smart and it asks you please provide the name of the city and state you would like the weather information for for example it gives you this example also so then you can say give me weather weather of Tokyo and it tells you the weather of Tokyo now let's say I want to know how many how many days of vacation I have let's say like this my name is Bob how many days vacation I have you have 20 days of vacation enjoy your time off so as you can see here the agent orchestrator understand which agent is capable doing this task and this orchestrator handled the task to these different agents now I just want to show you how intelligent this agents can be without us doing much work so if I say book a ticket of course it does not have agent which can book a ticket make a API call and all but still it play along with you and says hey to assist you better could you please provide more detail about the ticket you want to book like destination city departure City return date Etc and this is just out of the box me doing nothing about booking a ticket so there are more things we will come back to talk about them now let's look at the code and see what's happening there you can see here the code is very simple we take the user input and we pass the user input the plain vanilla English into agent orchestrator of course this PL vanilla English can come out of another method where you are converting the voice into text so you can take the voice commands also so agent orchestrator let's look at it this is doing the bulk of the work this agent orchestrator figuring out which method to call now here we have a message defined which is where we tell the chatbot what is your role and what is the content you are getting and this content is the prompt which user has typed and then we create a array of tool list which is nothing but defining what functions we have for the system to call so here you can see this Json which says there's a function it function name is here and the description so this description is important because this tells the chat GPD which method to be called for which query of the user as you can see then I'm defining the second function here and you can Define multiple functions don't worry about the Json structure and all I'll share the code on the GitHub and you will get the detail of this from the open AI do M mentation also now after that we'll just make one call chat completion call and there we pass this two list and here we said Auto Tool choice is auto so let the system decide which tool need to be called depending on the user prompt and you see here it returns tool calls so if I have tool calls it means I'm going to call these tools so when we get into this in tool calls we Define another object where we Define our two functions which we have written current weather and get vacation and then we do a for loop on the tools call it is possible that I have multiple agents right and multiple different functions are there and for one prompt I may have to call three different agents to do certain things that's why I have this four Loop for Tool calls here but in this example most probably all the time I will be having just one call for one function because I'm either talking about vacation or either talking about the weather and once I fill up this vacation name and then I load the uh function argument from Tool call remember tool call is coming out of this tools call which is again coming out of tool list where we Define this whole function and the parameters what unit should be there what is the description of these parameters now I have function argument and we customize a little bit here each function depending on uh what kind of parameter these function functions are taking so this is taking location and unit and this is taking only the username so you customize it little bit and then create a message object where again you pass the tools call ID which come out of the first call and then give the function name and then just call again the chat completion API with giving a new message object and this message object has the function name and the user message and whatever response you get out of it you return it to you so this is a as you can see it's a very simple code Now quickly look at our these methods a get vacation now this get vacation should be in real life should be calling your database which is again nothing special there but just to make this demo work quickly I hardcoded get vacation same about the get current weather I just hardcoded this but in real life you can call an API and do whatever need to be done so thank you for your time this is a very night agent in Python and interact with the real Enterprise different Enterprise systems and please let the feedback coming and let me know what else you wouldd like to see on this channel thank you\""
